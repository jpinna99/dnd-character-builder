Start at Level 1
After first session, we will be at Level 2

Our characters already did a mission together, but it did not go well
Guildmaster Varis Flintmantle believes that there is a dragon cult out there trying to raise Tiamat
She is giving us a second opportunity to help her thwart the dragon cult

Failed mission: earlier that day, we were escorting someone to Oakvale, Lorn Rennick, a minor noble of forest elf ancestry. It should have been simple, but things quickly unraveled. There was a goblin ambush and luckily Lord Rennick revealed himself as skilled swordsman. We managed to fight off the goblins.

Over embersteels in The Bloated Goat, we dissect the past events. We meet a gnome Blade named Bramblon who gives us a note and tells us to rendesvous at 7AM the next day. We then meet two Blade humans who give us backhanded compliments and show no confidence in our abilities. Soveliss attempted an intimidation roll with pitiful results.

The next day, we meet Vorath the Blacksmith at the Ironclad Hearth in town. Soveliss almost overslept but was woken up by Titus and Thalia; he was quite alarmed and instinctively summoned Shadow Armor in defense. Vorath needs us to get a particular hammer from the Mystic Cavern for his work. We head to the Mystic Cavern. We fought a bunch of kobolds and survived! We found a room with a table with the name of Vorath, Kosha, Ladra, Jayden, Grady, and another name â€” Umbrysill. Titus and Hildy got a 1d4 for inspiration for drinking the ale from barrels in one of the rooms. Soveliss drank the same ale a bit later but gained no inspiration. Hildy investigated the desk and found 2 potions of minor healing! We also found a sketch of a dragon-like creature. We found some runes on the north wall; we saw two dragons in battle with armies next to them. Riddles we answered: "I have cities, but no houses. I have forests, but no trees. I have rivers, but no water. What am I?" "The more of this there is, the less you see. What is it?" "I rise without breath, stand without bone, crowned in white or cloaked in stone. I never move, yet wanderers climb. Their lives I measure, step by time. I watch the world from roots to skies, old as silence, cold as lies." Thalia gave us all magic stones to hurl. 
We succeed in getting the hammer, we convene at Vorath's feast, we feast with Vorath and Varis, they feed us, explaining Varis's test to us, places parchment onto table: bestowing 4 items onto the group. 
Varis gives us each a sigil. She sends us to Greenest. Rumor is that some dragon cult members have shown their faces and are trying to bring Tiamat back.
